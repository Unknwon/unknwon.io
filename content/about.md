Welcome!

I'm a software engineer at [Sourcegraph](https://sourcegraph.com) who emphasizes on good design and code quality. 

I love using Go and did a lot work with it, some of them including:

- The [Gogs](https://gogs.io) project: A painless self-hosted Git service.
- The [Macaron](https://go-macaron.com) web framework: A high productive and modular web framework in Go.
- The [Peach Docs](https://peachdocs.org) tool: A web server for multi-language, real-time synchronization and searchable documentation.
- The [go-ini/ini](https://ini.unknwon.io) package: A fantastic package for INI manipulations in Go.
- The [go-clog/clog](https://github.com/go-clog/clog) package: A channel-based logging package for Go.
- And many popular Go packages, please checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/unknwon) profile.

At current, I want to become a full-stack software engineer, be professional at backend and have compelling skills at frontend, mainly focus on developer tooling and cloud automation. Besides, I want to have essential knowledge about business and management outside technology field. 

As a great man once said, "Good good study, day day up!".
